.TH "TACACS.CONF" "5" "@RELEASE_MONTH@" "@PACKAGE_NAME@" "File Formats"
.SH NAME
tacacs.conf, .tacacsrc \- TACACS configuration file/environment variables

.SH SYNOPSIS
@sysconfdir@/tacacs.conf, tacacsrc, .tacacsrc, $TACACS<option-name>

.SH DESCRIPTION
If the environment variable \fBTACACSNOINIT\fR is defined, all defaulting is
disabled.

The \fItacacs.conf\fR configuration file is used to set system-wide defaults to
be applied when running \fITACACS\fR clients.

Users may create an optional configuration file, \fItacacsrc\fR or
\fI.tacacsrc\fR, in their home directory which will be used to override the
system-wide defaults file. 

Additional configuration files can be specified using the \fBTACACSCONF\fR and
\fBTACACSRC\fR environment variables. \fBTACACSCONF\fR may be set to the path
of a configuration file. This path can be absolute or relative to the current
working directory. The \fBTACACSRC\fR, if defined, should be the basename
of a file in the user's home directory.

Environmental variables may also be used to augment the file based
defaults. The name of the variable is the option name with an added
prefix of \fBTACACS\fR. For example, to define \fBURL\fR via the environment,
set the variable \fBTACACSURL\fR to the desired value.

Thus the following files and variables are read, in order:
.nf
    variable     $TACACSNOINIT, and if that is not set:
    system file  @sysconfdir@/tacacs.conf,
    user files   $HOME/tacacsrc,  $HOME/.tacacsrc
    system file  $TACACSCONF,
    user files   $HOME/$TACACSRC, $HOME/.$TACACSRC
    variables    $TACACS<uppercase option name>.
.fi
Settings late in the list override earlier ones.

.SH SYNTAX
The configuration options are case-insensitive; their value, on a case
by case basis, may be case-sensitive.

Blank lines are ignored. Lines beginning with a hash mark (`#') are comments,
and ignored.

Valid lines are made of an option's name followed by white space and a value.
The value starts with the first non-white space character after the option's
name, and terminates with the first white space character unless the value is
encapsulated in either single quotes or double quotes. If a value contains
a white space character, the value must be encapsulated in either double quotes
of single quotes. If a value contains a single quote character, the value must
be encapsulated in double quotes. If a value contains a double quote
character, the value must be encapsulated in single quotes. A value may not
contain both single quotes and double quotes. Lines may only contain one
option and one value.  Lines may be terminated by comments. Invalid lines
are silently ignored.

For example,

.nf
        # Wrong - requires quotes:
        URL     tacacs:// tacplus://

        # Right - quoted URLs
        URL     "tacacs:// tacplus://"

        # Right - comments terminating line
        secret  "mySecretKey"  # default secret
.fi

.SH OPTIONS
The different configuration options are:

.TP
\fBKEEPALIVE_IDLE\fR \fIseconds\fR
Sets the number of seconds a connection needs to remain idle before TCP starts
sending keepalive probes.

.TP
\fBKEEPALIVE_INTERVAL\fR \fIseconds\fR
Sets the interval in seconds between individual keepalive probes.

.TP
\fBKEEPALIVE_PROBES\fR \fImaximum\fR
Sets the maximum number of keepalive probes TCP should send before dropping the
connection.

.TP
\fBNETWORK_TIMEOUT\fR \fIseconds\fR
Specifies the timeout (in seconds) after which the poll(2)/select(2) following
a connect(2) returns in case of no activity.

.TP
\fBSECRET\fR \fIstring\fR
Sets TACACS secret to \fIstring\fR.

.TP
\fBTIMEOUT\fR \fIseconds\fR
Sets the timeout in seconds to wait for requests to complete.

.TP
\fBUNENCRYPTED\fR [ \fIon\FR | \fIoff\fR ]
Disables use of secret to protect connection.

.TP
\fBURL\fR \fI<tacacs://name[:port]/>\fR
Specifies the URL(s) of an TACACS server(s) to which the \fITACACS\fR library
should connect. Each server's name can be specified as a domain-style name or
an IP address literal. Optionally, the server's name can followed by a ':' and
the port number of the TACACS service. If no port number is provided, the
default port of 49 is used.
